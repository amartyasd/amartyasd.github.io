This is the website for the Synthetic Seminar: Synthetic Modular Forms Computations, tentatively starting in April.

The goal of the seminar is to understand Carrick-Davies-van Nigtevecht's synthetic modular forms computations. The canonical reference is van Nigtevecht's PhD thesis.

Prerequisites for the seminar are a a background in stable homotopy theory and familiarity with stacks and sheaf cohomology.
