This is the website for the "Sati-Schreiber Twisted Equivariant Differential K-theory" reading seminar that's about to begin tentatively this term.
The goal of the seminar is to understand the premises of Sati-Schreiber's [Topological Quantum Programming in TED-K](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Topological+Quantum+Programming+in+TED-K#GMConAbs).

Here's a rough [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfmDwKK2k0fjr8-vN5W2tLQU-VtCSo23/view?usp=drive_link).

We have a Discord server for the seminar. For anyone interested, feel free to get in touch for the invite link.
