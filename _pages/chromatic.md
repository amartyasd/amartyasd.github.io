This is the website for the reading seminar "Chromatic Nullstellensatz" running on Fall 22-Spring 23. There's a Discord server for the group for whose link please contact me if you're interested. 

The goal of this seminar is to understand Burklund-Schlank-Yuan's Chromatic Nullstellensatz and redshift phenomena for algebraic K-theory of Eâˆž-rings.
We're meeting on Saturdays.
