This is the website for the reading seminar "Chromatic Nullstellensatz" running on Fall 2022-23. There's a Discord server for the group for whose link I can be contacted.  

The goal of this seminar is to understand Burklund-Schlank-Yuan's Chromatic Nullstellensatz and redshift phenomena for algebraic K-theory of E∞-rings.


We're set to begin this year probably starting from November 27th.
