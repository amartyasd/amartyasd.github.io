Experience

* Directed Reading Project(Advisor: - Dr Ulrik Buchholtz , University of Nottingham)(ongoing)
  The goal of the project currently is using the formal language of HoTT to reason internally to (oo,1)-toposes following work by Mike Shulman. I'm reading Shulman's paper titled "All (∞,1)-toposes have strict univalent universes".
