Here's my most recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C5RzJZfXMJ43LhL3bRxcBLCwIAOFzYwx/view?usp=sharing)


Education
======
* Integrated-Masters in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India, (2021-present)

Experience
======
* Directed Reading Project [Summer 2022] (Advisor: - [Dr Ulrik Buchholtz](https://ulrikbuchholtz.dk/) , University of Nottingham)
The goal of the project was understaning the use of the formal language of HoTT to reason internally to (∞, 1)-topoi following work by Mike Shulman. I specifically was  interested in non-presentable cases, to be specific,in elementary (∞, 1)-topoi semantics of HoTT. I read Mike Shulman's paper "[All (∞,1)-toposes have strict univalent universes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07004.pdf) " and Nima Rasekh's paper "[FILTER QUOTIENTS AND NON-PRESENTABLE (∞, 1)-TOPOSES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10088.pdf)", majorly apart from Emily's excellent survey paper "[ON THE ∞-TOPOS SEMANTICS OF HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/semantics.pdf).
As textbooks I used Cisinski's Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra, Riehl's Categorical Homotopy Theory, and Rezk's Higher Topos theory notes.
Towards the end of the project I got interested in Realizablity Models of HoTT, and am currently working on a Higher Realizability model of HoTT, which is work in progress.

* Directed Reading Project [Fall 2022] 
I'll be working this fall on a project on 'Generalised Thom spectra' as part of [Twoples](https://sites.google.com/view/twoples/about) mentorship program with [Julius Frank](https://sites.google.com/view/julius-frank/). I'm working primarily with [Schwede's notes](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/schwede/equivariant.pdf), Adam's blue book and Barnes-Roitzheim's book for the elementary stuff. I'm specifically interested in Ando-Blumberg-Gepner-Hopkins-Lurie's geometric R-module Thom spectra, and some THH computations.
