Education
======
* Integrated-Masters in Mathematics, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India, (2021-present)

Experience
======
* Directed Reading Project(Advisor: - Dr Ulrik Buchholtz , University of Nottingham)(ongoing)
  The goal of the project currently is using the formal language of HoTT to reason internally to (∞, 1)-topoi following work by Mike Shulman. I'm interested in non-presentable cases, to be specific, I'm interested in elementary (∞, 1)-topoi semantics of HoTT. I'm reading Mike Shulman's paper titled "All (∞,1)-toposes have strict univalent universes" and Nima Rasekh's paper "FILTER QUOTIENTS AND NON-PRESENTABLE (∞, 1)-TOPOSES"
  I'm using Cisiski's Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra Riehl's Categorical Homotopy Theory, and Rezk's Higher Topos theory notes.
