Education
======
* Integrated-Masters in Mathematics, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India, (2021-present)

Experience
======
* Directed Reading Project(Advisor: - [Dr Ulrik Buchholtz](https://ulrikbuchholtz.dk/) , University of Nottingham)(ongoing)
  The goal of the project currently is using the formal language of HoTT to reason internally to (∞, 1)-topoi following work by Mike Shulman. I'm interested in non-presentable cases, to be specific, I'm interested in elementary (∞, 1)-topoi semantics of HoTT. I'm reading Mike Shulman's paper "[All (∞,1)-toposes have strict univalent universes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07004.pdf) " and Nima Rasekh's paper "[FILTER QUOTIENTS AND NON-PRESENTABLE (∞, 1)-TOPOSES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10088.pdf)"
  I'm using Cisinski's Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra,Riehl's Categorical Homotopy Theory, and Rezk's Higher Topos theory notes.
