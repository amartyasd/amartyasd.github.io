Hello ! I'm an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India.

I've a wide range of interests. I'm currently interested in (stable) Homotopy Theory , Higher (Model) category theory, Higher Algebra, Higher Topos Theory, Homotopy Type Theory and Categorical Logic, all of which I'm constantly learning. I've also recently been intersted in Higher Operads, topological modular forms and some chromatic stuff (chromatic redshift to be specific). Apart from these I also find Applied Category Theory and Topological Data Analysis(TDA) interesting.

Apart from these there are other ambitious projects and ventures that I wish to take up when my schedule permits. Currently they are the subjects of Equivariant cohomology theory of group actions on  manifolds ,Equivariant Bordism theories ,Higher THH, and Higher K-theory.

My view towards Mathematics as a subject is broad and I'm always open to ideas and themes coming from unknown waters in the unfathomable ocean of mathematics. (I believe after all there are infinitely many things in the mathematical universe that can interest us) 

Aside from my primary pre-occupations and interests, I'm also interested in Philosophy and lingustics(to some extent).
