Hello! I'm an undergraduate at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India.

I have a wide range of interests. I'm interested in different flavours, particularly Chromatic, Homotopy Theory, Algebraic K-THeory, TQFTs, Higher category theory, Higher Topos Theory, Equivariant Algebra, Homotopy Type Theory and Categorical Logic. To be more specific, currently, I'm primarily interested in redshift phenomena, Burklund-Yuan-Schlank's Chromatic Nullstellensatz, Galois descent in telescopically localised algebraic K-theory and Freed-Hopkins reflection positivity and invertible phases. I've also recently been interested in other stuff like ttg, some tmf calculations and other computational stuff. I also find Applied Category Theory and Topological Data Analysis(TDA) interesting.

Apart from these are other ambitious projects and ventures that I wish to take up when my schedule permits. They are the subjects of Higher THH, Higher K-theory, and the one and only "Telescope Conjecture".

My view of Mathematics is broad, and I'm always open to ideas and themes coming from unknown waters in the unfathomable ocean of mathematics. (I believe, after all, there are infinitely many things in the mathematical universe that can interest us) 

Aside from my primary preoccupations and interests, I'm also interested in Philosophy and linguistics (to some extent).
