I'm an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India. 

I'm interested in (stable) Homotopy Theory , Infinity category theory  and Homotopy Type Theory, all of which I'm constantly learning. I'm also a bit interested in Applied Category Theory, but I would say I'm yet to explore the subject deeply.
Apart from these there are also really ambitious projects and ventures that I wish to take up when my schedule permits. They currently are the subjects of Equivariant cohomology theory of group actions on  manifolds, Higher Algebra (especially Brave New Algebra), Topos Theory and Algebraic K-theory.


As, I've just begun my mathematical journey formally, I've maintained a rather broad and open mindset to different mathematical areas. (I believe after all there are infinitely many things in the mathematical universe that can interest us) 

Aside from my primary pre-occupations and interests, I'm also interested in Logic and Philosophy.
