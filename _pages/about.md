I'm an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India. 

I'm interested in stable homotopy theory , infinity category theory ,simplicial homotopy theory and applied cateogry theory, all of which I'm constantly learning.
I think the invention or rather discovery from the platonist point, of view of the language of categories is the best thing that has happened to humanity 

I like thinking about almost everything I see , feel and work with categorically.

As, I've just begun my mathematical journey, I've kept a really open mindset about what I may end up working on.(There exist  infinitely many things in mathematics, after all) 

Aside from Mathematics, I'm also a bit interested in Philosophy.
