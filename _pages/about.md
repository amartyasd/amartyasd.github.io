I'm an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India. 

I'm interested in (stable) homotopy theory , infinity category theory  and Homotopy Type Theory, all of which I'm constantly learning.
As, I've just begun my mathematical journey, I've kept a really open mindset about what I may end up working on.(There exist  infinitely many things in mathematics, after all) 

Aside from Mathematics, I'm also a bit interested in Philosophy.
