This is the website for the DAG seminar centred around Tannaka duality for geometric stacks, starting tentatively in mid-October or early-November.
The goal of the seminar is to understand Steffanich's Tannaka duality statement, which refines Lurie's result by eliminating the tameness hypotheses, by means of an affineness result. 

Prerequisites for the seminar are a bare-bones knowledge of derived algebraic geometry and its objects (there's some scope for compromise here, though), and an understanding of infinity-categories. For participants who need a speed run through the basic notions, [Jeroen Hekking's](https://www.jeroenhekking.nl/teaching/introduction-to-derived-algebraic-geometry) course notes are recommended.

Syllabus: TBA. 

There's a Discord server for the seminar and a mailing list. To be added to any of them, please contact Amartya.
