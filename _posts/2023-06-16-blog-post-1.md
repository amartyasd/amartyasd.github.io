$N_{\infty}$-operads and associahedra
======

June 16, 2023


This time, we want a combinatorial understanding of  $N_{\infty}$-operads in a suitable $G$-equivariant setting. The goal is establishing, for $G=C_{p^n}$, a one-one correspondence between the natural order on the collection of $N_{\infty}$-operads and the poset structure of Stasheff's $(n+1)$-associahedron, $\mathcal{A}_{n+1}$. This is work by Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim.
 

Instead of the traditional way, as mentioned right at the article's outset, we want to understand $N_{\infty}$-operads differently, a combinatorial way. The key player is the following result that was conjectured by Blumberg-Hill [1], and proved by a series of works by Bonventre-Pereira; Guti√©rrez-White; and Rubin, independently. I just state the result with getting into the details of the proof


$\mathbf{Theorem} \\ 1.1 \\ $

$$\text{Ho}\left(N_{\infty}\text{-op} \right) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathfrak{Ind}$$ *where* $N_{\infty}\text{-op}$ *is the category of* $N_{\infty}$*-operads,  and* $\mathfrak{Ind}$ *is the category of indexing systems with poset structure.*

Now we'll see what *indexing systems* are next.

For that they're some machinery that we introduce first.

$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.1 \\ $

A categorical coefficient system is a contravariant functor
$$\underline{\mathcal{C}} : \text{Orb}_{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{Cat}$$

from the orbit category of $G$ to the category of small categories.

Typically, there's an abuse of notation by omitting the word *categorical*.

We have the notion of a *symmetric monoidal* coefficient system, which is a contravariant functor from the orbit category of $G$ to the category of symmetric monoidal categories and strong symmetric monoidal functors.

The category of interest for us is the category
