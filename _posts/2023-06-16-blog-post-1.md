$N_{\infty}$-operads and associahedra
======

June 16, 2023

Defining an $N_{\infty}$-operad using transfer systems
------


This time, we want a combinatorial understanding of  $N_{\infty}$-operads in a suitable $G$-equivariant setting. The goal is establishing, for $G=C_{p^n}$, a one-one correspondence between the natural order on the collection of $N_{\infty}$-operads and the poset structure of Stasheff's $(n+1)$-associahedron, $\mathcal{A}_{n+1}$. This is work by Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim.
 

Instead of the traditional way, as mentioned right at the article's outset, we want to understand $N_{\infty}$-operads differently, a combinatorial way. The key player is the following result that was conjectured by Blumberg-Hill [1], and proved by a series of works by Bonventre-Pereira; Gutiérrez-White; and Rubin, independently. I just state the result with getting into the details of the proof


$\mathbf{Theorem} \\ 1.1. \\ $

$$\text{Ho}\left(N_{\infty}\text{-op} \right) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathfrak{Ind}$$ *where* $N_{\infty}\text{-op}$ *is the category of* $N_{\infty}$*-operads,  and* $\mathfrak{Ind}$ *is the category of indexing systems with poset structure.*

Now we'll see what *indexing systems* are next.

For that they're some machinery that we introduce first.

$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.2. \\ $
A categorical coefficient system is a contravariant functor
$$\underline{\mathcal{C}} : \text{Orb}_{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{Cat}$$

from the orbit category of $G$ to the category of small categories.

Typically, there's an abuse of notation by omitting the word *categorical*.

We have the notion of a *symmetric monoidal* coefficient system, which is a contravariant functor from the orbit category of $G$ to the category of symmetric monoidal categories and strong symmetric monoidal functors.

The category of interest for us is the coefficient system of finite G-sets.

$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.3. \\ $
Suppose $\underline{\mathcal{Set}}$ is the symmetric monoidal coefficient system of finite sets, with $\underline{\mathcal{Set}}(H) = \mathcal{Set}^{H}$. The symmetric monoidal operation is the disjoint union.


Now the idea is to associate to every $N_{\infty}$-operad a sub coefficient system of $\underline{\mathcal{Set}}$. 

What follows next is the definition of an indexing system using all the machinery we've introduced.


$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.4. \\ $
An indexing system is a sub symmetric monoidal coefficient system that's closed under subobjects and self-induction.

Now the latter condition, for a full sub symmetric monoidal coefficient system $\mathcal{Z}$ translates to the following

$$ H/H' \in \mathcal{Z}(H) \\ \wedge K \\ \in \mathcal{Z}(H') \Rightarrow H \times_{H'} K \in \mathcal{Z}(H)$$  

We now compare indexing systems to transfer systems [].


$\mathbf{Lemma} \\ 1.5. \\ $
*An indexing system determines (and is also determined by) a set* $\mathcal{Z}_{H}$ *for* $H \leq G$, *with subgroups of $H$ satisfying the following axioms:*

* $H/H \in \mathcal{Z}(H)$

* $H/H' \in \mathcal{Z}(H) \Rightarrow gHg^{-1}/gH'g^{-1} \in g\mathcal{Z}g^{-1}$

* $H/H' \in \mathcal{Z}(H) \\ \wedge \\ H'/K \in \mathcal{Z}(h') \Rightarrow H/K \in \mathcal{Z}(H)$

* $H/H' \in \mathcal{Z}(H) \Rightarrow K\(K \cap H') \in \mathcal{K} \\ , \forall \\ K \leq H$


*All this data is referred to as a transfer system.*

Alternatively, we've the following defintion.

$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.6. \\ $
For a transfer system $\mathcal{Z}(H)$ we can define a set abstractly 

$$\\{ N_{H'}^{H} \mid H/H' \in \mathcal{Z}(H),  H \leq  G \\}$$

We call these out *norm maps*.

Using all these, now we've an alternate description of an $N_{infty}$-operad that I state next.


$\mathbf{Cor} \\ 1.6. \\ $

$G$ *is a finite group. An* $N_{\infty}$ *operad for* $G$, *upto homotopy is defined as the data of the set* $X = \\{N_{H}^{K} \mid 1 \leq K < H \leq G \\}$ *satisfying the following (and all conjugates thereof)*

*  $N_{H}^{K} \in X \\ \wedge M < H \Rightarrow N_{K \cap M}^{M} \in X$       *(Restriction Axiom aka* $\mathfrak{RA}$)
*  $N_{L}^{K} \in X \\ \wedge N_{H}^{K} \in X \Rightarrow N_{L}^{H} \in X$      *(Composition Axiom aka* $\mathfrak{CA}$)



It's important to note that the notation choice makes sense so that the Mackey functor of an algebra $A$ over an $N_{\infty}$-operad $\mathcal{O}$ has multiplicative norm maps $N_{K}^{H}: \pi_{0}^{K}(A) \rightarrow \pi_{0}^{H}(A)$.


The case of $G= C_{p^n}$
------

We now look at the case of interest, i.e. when $G= C_{p^n}$ where $p$ is a prime. 

The goal is to understand the sequence $\\{ |N_{\infty}(C_{p^n}) | \\}$ .

The cases of $n=0$ and $n=1$ are trivial. We look at the case of $n=2$.

We start by drawing out all our possibilities and then using the axioms $\mathfrak{RA}$ and $\mathfrak{CA}$ to eliminate redundant structures.

| <img src="/images/n=2 examples part(2).png" alt="Same cases" width="400"/> |


The third structure i.e. $\\{N_{0}^{1}, N_{1}^{2} \\}$ isn't an $N_{\infty}$-structure using $\mathfrak{CA}$ and the sixth and eighth structures i.e. $\\{N_{0}^{2}, N_{1}^{2} \\} \\ , \\ \\{N_{0}^{2} \\}$ aren't $N_{\infty}$-structures by an application of $\mathfrak{RA}$.


Thus we can conclude that  $|N_{\infty}(C_{p^2}) | = 5$

There's an obvious pattern that we've here.

We now spend some time recalling the Catalan Numbers, which obviously have been popping up so far.

The Catalan sequence is a very common sequence popping up in various enumerations problems, two of which we'll use directly. We first define the sequence.

$\mathbf{Def} \\ 1.6. \\ $
The Catalan numbers are terms of the sequence $\\{ C_n \\}$ defined as follows:

$$C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}$$

We also recall that they satisfy the following recurrence relation.

$$C_0 = 1$$

$$C_{n+1} = \sum_{l=0}^{n}C_l C_{n-l} \\ , \\ n\geq 0$$

Some examples of enumeration problems where Catalan numbers pop up are the following:

*  $C_n =$ # rooted binary trees with $n+1$ vertices
*  $C_n =$ # ways of cutting a convex polygon with $n+2$ sides into triangles
*  $C_n=$ # permutations of $\\{1, \cdots , n\\}$ with no three terms in increasing order

  
BBR product
------
We now define an operation on $N_{\infty}$-operads that I choose to call the *Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim (BBR) product* also referred to as the *o-dot product*.

$$\odot: N_{\infty}(C_{p^k}) \times N_{\infty}(C_{p^{l}}) \rightarrow N_{\infty}(C_{p^{k+l+2}}) $$

For $X \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^k})$ and $X' \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^l})$, $X \odot X'  \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{k+l+2}})$ is defined as follows:

$$X \odot X' = X \coprod \Sigma^{k+2}X' \coprod \\{N_{k+1}^{m} \\}_{k+1 < m \leq k+k+2}$$

where $\Sigma^{j}N_{a}^{b} = N_{a+j}^{b+j}$

Now there's a pictorial way to work and see things that we see next

|:--:|
|Pictorial illustration of the BBR product from the BBR paper[] |

We now see an example:

Let $X,Y \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^2})$ 

| <img src="/images/BBR operation example.png" alt="BBR product example" width="700"/> |
|:--:|
|It's easy to see how the operation works and that it's not commutative |

We now see the result that lets us use the BBR product for our purposes.

$\mathbf{Prop} \\ 1.6. \\ $
$X \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^k})$ *and* $Y \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^l})$. $X \odot Y$ *is an object in* $N_{\infty}(C_{p^{k+l+2}})$ *for* $k,l \geq -1$. *Also conversely, if we've* $X \odot Y \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{k+l+2}})$ *then* $X$ *and* $Y$ *are* $N_{\infty}$ *structures.* 

Now we make our next step towards computing $| N_{\infty}(C_{p^{n}}) |$

$\mathbf{Prop} \\ 1.6. \\ $
*We have the following recurrence relation*

$$|N_{\infty}(C_{p^{-1}}) | = 1$$

$$|N_{\infty}(C_{p^n})| = \sum_{q=0}^{n}|N_{\infty}(C_{p^{q-1}})| |N_{\infty}(C_{p^{n-q-1}})|, \\ n \geq 0$$

The idea of the proof is to use the last proposition after showing that every $X \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^n})$ can be written as $X = Y \cdot Z$ where $Y \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{q-1}})$ and $Z \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{n-q-1}})$


Now we begin with $j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that it's the minimum integer such that $N_{n}^{j}$ is in $X$.
The cases of $j=0$ and $j=n$ are straightforward with $Y = \emptyset$ and $Z = \emptyset$ in both the cases.

Now if $O < j < n$, then clearly we can split off $C_{p^i}$ with $0 \leq i < j$. Let's call this part $Y \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{j-1}})$ and the remaining part $X'$
Now it's easy to see that this part's like $\emptyset \cdot Z$ for some $Z \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^{n-j-1}})$. 

We can thus conclude that $X = Y \cdot Z$


Now a consequence of the previous result is the following corollary


$\mathbf{Cor} \\ 1.6. \\ $

*For* $G= C_{p^n}$, *and* $X \in N_{\infty}(C_{p^n})$ *we can write* $X = Y \cdot Z$ *for some suitable* $N_{\infty}$-*operads* $Y$ *and* $Z$.


Now as a corollary to this
